Hello[^1], this is an example article showing the capabilities of
[Panblog](https://github.com/marvinborner/panblog)!

To see more examples, go to [my real
blog](https://text.marvinborner.de).

# Code

Code snippets with syntax highlighting:

``` haskell
fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
powerSet = filterM $ const [True, False]
```

Supports even the weirdest languages!

``` c
void main() {
    !error_occured() ??!??! handle_error();
    return 0;
}
```

# $\LaTeX$

Panblog supports $\LaTeX$!

$$\nabla x\nabla p\approx\hslash$$
$$x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$

# Mermaid

Generate mermaid diagrams using the `mermaid` filter!

``` {.mermaid background="transparent" caption="cool sequence diagram"}
sequenceDiagram
